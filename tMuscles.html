          <h2>Increase Vitality</h2>
          <p>One of the fastest ways to establish healthy habits is to follow my favorite vitality tips for our health, 
            because when it comes to boosting your vitality, Energy is important as it allows our bodies and minds to execute a series of activities throughout 
            the day and in our lives. This energy is derived from the foods we eat and the way our bodies process them. As such,
             it becomes crucial to consume the types of food that help boost energy and promote vitality.</p>

          <h2>Physical fitness</h2>
          <p>Physical fitness is the level of the physical condition that the athlete depends on in the components of physical fitness for his sport, 
              which are measured by measuring devices and scientific tests and compared to the optimal level,You want to make sure you are working yourself into shape safely and effectively.
              Then, after week four, You'll be surprised how empowered you'll feel!
              or it is the individual's ability and physical competence to play his role in life without stress or fatigue.</p>

            <h2>Try starting with three 30-minute workouts a week to pace yourself.</h2>
            <p>If you are just starting a new workout program, don't overcommit or over-perform! Try starting with three days
                 a week, schedule it into your week like a doctor's appointment. No need to take a full class—stay for 30 minutes, 
                 or try a short private training session or an at-home workout. 
                try adding another 30 minutes every other week.</p>

            <h2> Prioritize consistency over intensity.</h2>
            <p>"You are better off doing a 45-minute, moderate-intensity strength circuit 
                three times per week than to do a two-hour, high-intensity workout six times a week,
                 and then burning out in three weeks because it’s not sustainable. And remember that it takes time and consistency to build your body, 
                 but one workout can put you in a better mood. You leave it all in the gym: the annoying boss, the argument with your best friend. </p>

            <h2>Tune into that post-workout high, and enjoy it.</h2>
            <p>"Focus on the feels. Most fitness goals are long-term projects, but the one exception to this is how we feel, which can immediately and profoundly improve after a single workout. If you’re just starting out, tune into the positive vibes you feel after exercise and let that be your reward. Remember, even as a newbie, you’re only one workout away from a good mood." —Rob Sulaver</p>

            <h2>Motivation is a goal</h2>
            <p>"Motivation is what gets you started, but making things a habit is how you keep the longevity of an active lifestyle. Having friends, family, and coworkers that exercise with you can help you to persevere. Try to find workout buddies to do healthy things together. Also, what you do outside the gym will have a big influence on the workouts you do inside the gym—making positive changes in your nutrition, hydration, sleep, and stress levels will create big results." —Noam Tamir</p>

            <h2>Know that results don’t happen right away, and that’s OK.</h2>
            <p>“People come in with the expectation of long-term results happening fast, but people should look at fitness as a big picture and making exercise a part of their life routine, as opposed to an acute, momentary mindset. Also remember that working out is multi-faceted, and it's the combination of healthy eating and training together that creates the best results." —Jason Walsh</p>

            <h2>Do workouts you actually like—you're more likely to stick with it.</h2>
            <p>“My best advice for beginners is to find something you enjoy and focus on small, incremental progress each day. I believe that we get the best results from consistency, and in order to be consistent we need to enjoy the journey. That’s why I like to focus on small daily goals—small goals completed each day make for big progress over time and give us a sense of accomplishment daily.” —Milan Costich</p>

            <h2>Invest in a great pair of shoes.</h2>
            <p>"Wearing old, broken-down shoes can negatively impact your joints and ligaments,
                 especially if you're running, sprinting, or doing plyometrics. So selecting the correct shoes for your workout is important: 
                 For instance, tennis shoes are built for lateral movements. If you're lifting weights, you will want a harder, 
                 flatter bottom of your shoe so you feel more connected to the floor. And if you are a runner, most specialty running stores will give you a powe.

            <h2>avoid burnout and injury, start slow and take breaks during your workouts.</h2>
            <p>"Start slow, set realistic goals, be gentle with your body and take breaks as often as necessary. 
                Making the commitment to begin a new workout is hard enough, so if you’re not honest about your physical fitness level and go too hard, 
                you’re setting yourself up to potentially burn out or get injured, and that’s so far from the intended goal." —Lauren Kleban</p>

            <h2>Think of working out as an act of self-care.</h2>
            <p>"I always want my new clients to know that the journey they're about to embark upon tends to be the road less traveled. Those mental battles are hardest to deal with in the beginning stages so stay humble, stay committed, and know that the benefits far outweigh any difficulties. Wake up every day and remind yourself that self-care in all forms is the best decision you can make.” —Nick Malizia</p>
